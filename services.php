                Baseline offers turnkey design and construction of  new and existing natural and synthetic turf sports fields. We can supply drainage design, elevation determination, and layout for new construction. We will also install the sand/stone sub base for turf and install the turf, playing lines, and logos. For natural turf Baseline will outline and execute a grow in plan. For synthetic, Baseline works with all of the  best manufacturers in the industry, including  Shaw Sports Turf, to meet your needs and do it with style. Baseline also does synthetic turf maintenance. As a field ages, it is important to test it for player safety and to know when to add infill or replace an existing field.
                 We can provide GMAX testing as well as grooming and sales of field groomers and additional rubber.
